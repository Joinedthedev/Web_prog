            Hey there. My name is Salim Ahmed Babaji. I was born on January 9th, 2002, in Maryland, USA. I lived there
            for 16 years before moving to Nigeria in 2017.
            Majority of my educational journey was completed abroad but I've completed
            year 11 & 12 here in Abuja at Fouad Lababidi Islamic Academy. I graduated in 2020 and resumed my studies at
            Nile University of Nigeria pursuing a computer
            science degree and aspiring to be a
            game developer one day In Shaa Allah.
            I enjoy coding, watching anime, playing video games and occasionally
            reading & writing.

        <p>
            Below is a sample of the controller logic and physics I worked on a while ago for platformer web games. I'll
            continue to use this controller
            logic for various games in the future, tweaking them as i see fit depending on the project. You can check
            out my other projects such as my <a href="https://joinedthedev.github.io/Landing-Page-Project/">Landing Page
                Project</a>
            on my github: <a href="https://github.com/joinedthedev">My Github.</a> Thanks for reading!
